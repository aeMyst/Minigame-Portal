Board Setup:
Played on an 8x8 board with alternating dark and light squares. Only dark squares are used.
Each player starts with 12 pieces placed on the dark squares of the first three rows closest to them.

Objective:
Capture all of the opponent’s pieces or block them so they cannot make a move.

Basic Movement:
Pieces move diagonally forward to an adjacent unoccupied square.
If a jump is available (capturing an opponent’s piece by jumping over it to an empty square), it must be taken.

Capturing Pieces:
A piece can jump over an adjacent opponent’s piece if the square beyond it is empty.
Multiple jumps are allowed in a single turn if available.

Crowning Kings:
When a piece reaches the opponent’s back row, it becomes a king and is crowned.
Kings can move both forward and backward diagonally.

Winning:
A player wins by capturing all opponent’s pieces or when the opponent cannot make a valid move.
